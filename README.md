# code-in-place-word-frequency-counter
Code in Place final project **Word Frequency Counter**: The program gives two options to user to load text for analyzing 1) input through console 2) Load through plain txt file. 
The text to analyze is then sent to processing unit that processes each word and updates the count for the existing word by 1 if already present. We remove following words from the list-
1) Remove the leading spaces and newline character
2) Remove the punctuation marks from the line 
3) Remove the digits from the line
4) Remove words present in stop word list. For more information on stop word refere to following external link (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_word)

The program will finally generate following outputs- 
1) Gives total number of words
2) Max occurrence of a word
3) List of words and frequencies
4) Graph displaying top 25 words and frequency

Using Matplotlib a graph is generated -
